## Original HateXPlain Github Repository
* https://github.com/hate-alert/HateXplain

## Objective of the Project
- Replicate and reproduce results as the published paper on the BiRNN-HateXplain [Attn] model designed for Hate Speech Detection.
- Construct 2 new datasets and test them against the model.
    
## Contribution on New Dataset Construction 
- Dataset 1 Existing Hatespeech Research Dataset : Lei Yang
- Dataset 2 Twitter Dataset: Wei En Tiong
- The new datasets were constructed, preprocessed and evaluated by the creators seperately. 

## Result
- The original work was successfully replicated and similar results have been reproduced.
- Both the new datasets have very similar results in terms of bias and explainability with the original published results.
